=head1 NAME

Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG - InteractiveBrokers API C++ wrapper and connector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Create an object as a subclass of L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler>:

    my $handler = MyEventHandler->new();

Then:

    my $ib = Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG->new(
        handler => $handler,    # Your subclassed event handler
    );

    $ib->eConnect();
    $ib->reqCurrentTime();

    # Your event loop here
    $ib->processMessages()
        while( $ib->isConnected() );

    # And eventually...
    $ib->eDisconnect();

See the F<examples/> directory in this distribution for more complete and
well-commented examples.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides Perl connectivity to the InteractiveBrokers market data
and program trading service, using the IB-provided C++ code.  It is primarily
intended to be used with L<POE::Component::Client::InteractiveBrokers>, which
provides a better API, but may be used standalone if desired, by referring
to the IB documentation itself (under L</"SEE ALSO">).

It is a very complex module with an involved build process, and as such, you
should read this documentation thoroughly before building or using this
module distribution.

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

The InteractiveBrokers API is available as either a set of C++ or Java
source files.  This module builds a library from this, and then runs SWIG
(the Simplified Interface Wrapper and Generator) against it to provide
Perl connectivity.

The API consists of several methods, callable from this module, as well
as several events, containing the asynchronous responses from IB to
event handlers you have created.

In order to catch the events, you must subclass
L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler>, and override all of
the events therein with your own code to handle their responses (e.g.
save them to a database, or do whatever).

You then pass your C<$handler> into L</"new()">, and you will have complete
access to the IB API, delegated via XS through the C++ library.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

You must have the following to build and use this module:

=over 4

=item * L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::API>

Provides a programmatic means of looking up methods and events in the IB API.

=item * A working build environment

Capable of compiling C and C++ files, and running 'make'.

=item * SWIG >= 1.3.28

The "Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator", capable of building SWIG
interfaces.  This module has been tested with SWIG versions 1.3.28 - 2.0.1.

=back

And optional, but I<highly> recommended:

=over 4

=item * L<Alien::InteractiveBrokers>

Installs (downloading if necessary) the InteractiveBrokers API files,
and provides I<Perl>-y mechanisms for locating them.

=back

You can find links to SWIG and the IB API in L</"SEE ALSO">.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new()

    my $ib = Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG->new(
        handler => $handler,    # Subclassed F::IB::SWIG::EventHandler object 
    );

B<ARGUMENTS:>

B<handler =E<gt> $handler> [ B<REQUIRED> ]

This must be an instantiated object that is a subclass of
L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler>.  It is delegated to when
receiving events from the IB service.

Please see L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler> for notes on
how to subclass it, and the F<examples/> directory of this distribution.

B<RETURNS:> blessed C<$object>, or C<undef> on failure.

=head2 initialize()

    my %leftover = $self->initialize( %ARGS );

Initialize the object.  If you are subclassing, override this, not L</new()>.

B<ARGUMENTS:> C<%HASH> of arguments passed into L</new()>

B<RETURNS:> C<%HASH> of any leftover arguments.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 api_methods()

    my @api_methods = $ib->api_methods();

or

    my @api_methods = Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::api_methods();

Get a list of IB API methods you can call from this class.  These correspond
1:1 to the IB API methods, but they are dynamically dispatched, so you won't
find actual C<sub> definitions for them in the source.

B<ARGUMENTS:> None.

B<RETURNS:> C<@ARRAY> of callable IB API methods.

B<NOTE:> You can also get a list of them from the command line, via:

    perl -MFinance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG -e'print Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::api_methods'

=head2 eConnect()

Small wrapper around the IB API eConnect() call to add DNS resolution.
See L</"INTERACTIVE BROKERS API"> for full information on how to use the
IB API.

=head2 api_version()

    my $version = $ib->api_version();

Get the IB API version this module was compiled against.

B<RETURNS:> C<$scalar> containing the version as a string, something like
C<'9.64'>.

=head1 INTERACTIVE BROKERS API

The IB API is not described in this documentation.  You should refer to
their website (L</"SEE ALSO">) for notes on how to use it and what methods
and events are available.
