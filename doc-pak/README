Finance-InteractiveBrokers-SWIG

This module provides Perl connectivity to the InteractiveBrokers market data
and program trading service, using the IB-provided C++ code.  It is primarily
intended to be used with L<POE::Component::Client::InteractiveBrokers>, which
provides a better API, but may be used standalone if desired, by referring
to the IB documentation itself (under L</"SEE ALSO">).

It is a very complex module with an involved build process, and thus you
should read the documentation thoroughly.


PREREQUISITES

You must have the following to build and use this module:

* Finance::InteractiveBrokers::API

    Provides a programmatic means of looking up methods and events in the
    IB API.

* A working build environment

    Capable of compiling C and C++ files, and running 'make'.

* SWIG >= 1.3.28

    The "Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator", capable of building SWIG
    interfaces.  This module has been tested with versions from 1.3.28-2.0.1.

Optional, but highly recommended:

* Alien::InteractiveBrokers

    Installs (downloading if necessary) the InteractiveBrokers API files,
    and provides Perly mechanisms for locating them.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


HOW IT WORKS

The IB API is available as either a set of C++ or Java source code files.
This module builds a library from this, and then runs SWIG (the Simplified
Interface Wrapper and Generator) against it to provide Perl connectivity.

The API consists of several methods, callable from this module, as well
as several events, containing the asynchronous responses from IB to
methods you have called.

In order to catch the events, you must subclass
L<Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler>, and override all of
the events therein with your own code to handle their responses (e.g.
save them to a database, or do whatever).

You then pass your $handler into ->new(), and you have complete access
to the IB API, delegated through the C++ library.


NOTES ON BUILDING ON OS-X

When building on OS-X, you may see warnings similar to the following, when
linking the final dynamic library:

ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/lib'
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/lib'
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/lib'
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/lib'

This is avoidable, but it would reduce the flexibility and require a much
more convoluted build process.

An explanation of why this happens: When distributing modules, especially
binary modules as complex as Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG for myriad
end-user platforms, the only way to get an idea of the local system's
configuration is to query Perl itself, via various methods.  The build
process expects that, since perl is built and (hopefully!) working, that
its configuration will work.  This is not the case if the people who
packaged your copy of 'perl' do not use a common system configuration such as
would be found on an OS-X end-user's machine.  In particular, it looks like
the packagers had some libraries installed in '/usr/local/lib', which is
not necessarily a normal directory on OS-X.  Blame them, not me.

The solution is to ignore these warnings; the final build works fine, if
everything else has completed successfully, and a 'make test' reports a
PASS.
