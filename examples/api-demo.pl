#   Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG - API demonstration program
#
#   (c) 2010-2013 Jason McManus
#
#   This demonstration program shows how to use the F::IB::SWIG
#   package to work with the IB API, and receive events.
#
#   Steps:
#   ------
#   0. Set up either the IB Gateway or the TradeWorkstation interface.
#      (see the IB API documentation for details.  The API must use one
#      of these to connect to their service.
#   1. Subclass Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler, create
#      actions for its events, and instantiate an object.
#   2. Call Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG->new, and give it your
#      handler.
#   3. Call ->eConnect( $host, $port, $id ) giving it the host and
#      port of your IB Gateway or TWS server.
#   4. Set up an event loop calling ->processMessages() each time
#      through, so that your event handlers will be called.
#   5. When the event loop is through, call ->eDisconnect() to hang up
#      politely.

### Variables
###

use vars qw( $TRUE $FALSE );
*TRUE  = \1;
*FALSE = \0;

my $ibhost      = 'localhost';  # Set to your IB gateway or TWS host
my $ibport      = 4001;         # Set to your IB gateway or TWS port
my $clientId    = 42;           # Some random number as a client ID

my $wantstoexit = 0;            # Flag to check for ^C; ignore this

###
### Main
###

#
# 1. Create our event handler object to react to incoming events
#    (You can see MyEventHandler.pm in this same directory.)
#
my $handler = MyEventHandler->new();

#
# 2. Create a F::IB::SWIG object so we can make requests
#
my $ibapi = Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG->new(
    handler => $handler,
);

#
# 3. Tell the API to connect to the IB Gateway or TWS host
#
print "Connecting to $ibhost:$ibport with clientID = $clientId... ";

if( $ibapi->eConnect( $ibhost, $ibport, $clientId ) ) {
    print "Connected!\n";
} else {
    die "\nConnection to $ibhost:$ibport failed.";
}

#
# Let's set up a signal handler to catch ^C (SIGINT) events
#
$SIG{INT} = sub { $wantstoexit = 1; };

#
# Let's request the current time on the server
#
print "Sending request for current server time.\n";

$ibapi->reqCurrentTime();

#
# Let's also request a quote for MSFT
#

# Set up a contract object

my $contract = Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::IBAPI::Contract->new();
$contract->swig_symbol_set( 'MSFT' );
$contract->swig_secType_set( 'STK' );
$contract->swig_exchange_set( 'SMART' );
$contract->swig_currency_set( 'USD' );

# Send the request

my $reqId = get_next_id();
print "Sending snapshot request (reqId $reqId) for MSFT.\n";

$ibapi->reqMktData(
    $reqId,             # next id from the sequence generator
    $contract,          # above contract object
    '',                 # don't set this if snapshot (next value) is true
    $TRUE,              # just get a snapshot and immediately cancel
);

#
# 4. MAIN EVENT LOOP; keep going in here until ^C is pressed
#
print "\nLooping to wait for server responses (^C to exit)...\n";

while( $ibapi->isConnected() and not $wantstoexit )
{
    $ibapi->processMessages();
}

#
# 5. Someone wanted to exit, let's clean up nicely.
#
print "^C detected; disconnecting...\n";
$ibapi->eDisconnect()
    if( $ibapi->isConnected() );

#
# Bye!
#
print "Bye!\n";
exit( 0 );

###
### Utility subs
###

# Just a closure to continually generate a new req id
#
# In a full program, these should probably be kept in a hash, with
# the Id set to the key, and the value set to 1 (or perhaps a reqtype,
# timestamp, or other meta information), and then deleted as the
# responses come in, or when a cancel request is sent, depending
# on if that's appropriate for the request or not.
#
# Remember, this is a low-level API.  Most of this will be done for you
# in the eventual POE component. :-)
#
# See also: the IB API documentation for the reqIDs() call
#
{
    my $id = 0;
    sub get_next_id
    {
        return ++$id;
    }
}
