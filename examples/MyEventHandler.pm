#
#   Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG - Demonstration event handler subclass
#
#   Copyright (c) 2010-2013 Jason McManus
#
#   To use this module:
#
#     Insert your code into the event handler subroutine skeletons.  These
#     will be triggered upon receiving the responses from the IB server,
#     at the appropriate times, according to their API documentation.
#
#     Fill them to do whatever you need to do to react to the event, e.g.
#     store data into a database, set a flag, execute a trade, etc.
#
#   NOTE: You /should/ double-check to make sure that all of the events
#     subroutines exist for the version of the API you compiled against.
#
#     You can get a list of events by typing:
#       
#       perl -MFinance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler -e'print Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler::override'
#
#     at your shell prompt.
#
#     Since IB updates its API regularly, if you compile against a newer
#     version, it's possible that some events may not be caught below, at
#     which point you will receive an exception that looks like:
#
#       Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler::EVENTNAME method
#          must be overridden
#        at line ....
#

use Carp qw( croak confess );
use Data::Dumper;
use strict;
use warnings;
use vars qw( $VERSION );
BEGIN {
    $VERSION = '0.10';
}

# Ours
use base qw( Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG::EventHandler );

###
### Event handlers
###
### These will be called by Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG when it
### receives the specified event from the server.  They will be called
### with their arguments in the same order as in the IB API documentation.
###
### Only a few methods are filled in for you, but this class will
### operate as a proper handler, and simply discard the events sent to
### the empty subs.  It is up to you to fill them in.
###
### Please see the InteractiveBrokers API documentation regarding EWrapper
### for a full description and list of arguments for each method.
